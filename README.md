# learning_data_mining
Learning how to pre-process data, K-means clustering and Naive Bayes (writing my own algorithm)

This was my first exam for the subject Data Mining at ITU in Copenhagen.
The main goal of this assigment was:
* To learn hwo to clean the data and get it ready to use it.
* Understand the data and ask proper questions to it.
* Create an algorithm for clustering (K-means), run it, and understand the results.
* Create an algorithm for unsupervised prediction (Naive Bayes), run it, and understand the results.
